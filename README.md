# Base64 to Image Converter

This project is a static web page built with HTML and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to convert Base64-encoded strings into images, calculate their file sizes, and add them to a history list.

## Features

- **Base64 to Image Conversion**: Users can input a Base64 string, which is then decoded and displayed as an image.
- **File Size Calculation**: The size of the image (in Kilo-bytes) is calculated and displayed alongside the image history.
- **History List**: A history feature that maintains a record of all previously processed images, including their Base64 strings and calculated sizes, you can retrieve it via click.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: The solution uses only vanilla JavaScript and HTML, with no external dependencies, making it fast and easy to use.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user enters a Base64-encoded string into the provided input field.
2. **Decoding**: The JavaScript decodes the Base64 string into an image format.
3. **Display**: The image is shown on the page, and its size is calculated and displayed in Kilo-bytes into history.
4. **History**: Every conversion is added to the history list, allowing users to track their previous conversions and images.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Paste a Base64 string into the input field.
4. Click the "Convert" button to decode the Base64 string and display the image.
5. The image will be added to the history list and the size (in Kilo-bytes) will be shown there.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
